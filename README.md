## 📌 About

This repository contains hands-on writeups for CTF machines and vulnerable labs. Each writeup follows a real-world penetration testing methodology — from initial recon to root — and is documented for learning and reference.

## 📋 Methodology

Every writeup follows this standard workflow:

```
1. Reconnaissance & Enumeration

5. Post-Exploitation & Flags
6. Summary & Lessons Learned
```

Aligned with **OWASP Testing Guide** and real-world penetration testing practices.
